00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:07.920
A histogram of 1991 and 2010 of employment&nbsp;
for disabled and non-disabled Americans.&nbsp;

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.000
As you can see the employment rate for&nbsp;
Americans without disabilities is much&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.860
higher than those with disabilities.
In general we have seen people with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.400
disabilities employed at nearly half&nbsp;
the rate of those without disabilities.
